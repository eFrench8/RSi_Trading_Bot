# RSi_Trading_Bot
A Simple trading bot that uses RSI (relative strength index) to buy and sell stock  
the simple stratergy involves buying a stock when the RSI falls below 30 which indicates the stock is oversold
and selling the stock when the RSI is over 70 which indicates that the stock is being overbought
